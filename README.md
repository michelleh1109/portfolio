I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Information Science, concentrating in Data Science, and also studying Environmental Economics. I am interested in the intersection between technology and social impact. 

My portfolio belows includes independent coding projects, environmental economics research, and additional data science projects. Below is a brief overview of a few key projects I have uploaded to my GitHub including when I created this, their functions, the skills I apply, how to run/view them, etc.
