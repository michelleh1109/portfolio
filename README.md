# Michelle Hui
I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Information Science, concentration in Data Science, and Environmental Economics. I am interested in the intersection between technology and social impact. 

My portfolio belows includes independent coding projects, environmental economics research, and additional data science projects. Below is a brief overview of a few key projects I have uploaded to my GitHub.

## Analyzing Amazon Reviews Data Science Project

**Overview**

This was a semester long data science research project I did with a partner. We investigated trends in Amazon Reviews with data such as review body, title, product being reviewed, verified purchase status, star rating etc. Our overall goal was to see if greater market/industry trends can be extrapolated from Amazon reviews. For example, if a brand is doing really well on Amazon, are they also doing very well in the industry?

**Skills Applied**
I coded this in python is Jupyter Notebook. I applied data science skills such as Data Cleaning/Wrangling, Text Sentiment Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Komogorov-Smirnov Test, Bootstrapping and Permutation Statistics.

## Negative Rebound: National Household Travel Survey Environmental Economics Data Science Research

**Overview**

Over summer 2021, I worked with Professor Mark Jacobsen at UC San Diego on environmental economics research. I independently led and developed analysis on the National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS), which consisted of household demographics, individual demographics, vehicle compositions, and trips taken by individuals/households, to develop empirical data to support the professor's theoretical analyses of the rebound effect. 

The specific goal of this empirical data analyses is to prove that decreasing the number of vehicles per household will also decrease the overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by the household. I do this by constructing the control household, controlling for factors such as household size, working status, student status, income, geographic density, number of children etc. Then I use this control household to understand how their vehicle miles traveled (VMT) changes as their household car composition changes. I was able to successfully prove that VMT does decrease as household car size decreases, visualize different patterns in VMT based on car type combinations and car age, trip type patterns based on car types. 

**Skills Applied**

I coded this in R (programming language) in R Studio. I applied data science skills such as data wrangling, building visualizations, working with large data sets, and statistical tests.
